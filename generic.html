							<p style="text-align: justify">Quantifying the structural changes in the environment due to the disaster can help in assessing the total damage in a location which in turn can help prioritize the locations (cells/rasters) during the path planning of drones.
								To attempt to quantify these changes, we extracted SIFT, SURF and ORB features from the pre and post-catastrophe images. These features are visualized below. The pre-catastrophe images were observed to have low spatial resolution relative to post-catastrophe images.
								Therefore, we were able to identify more features from the post-catastrophe images. This discrepancy in the number of features caused a difficulty in identifying which features in the pre-catastrophe image were actually changed.
								This could possibly show that working with the images in pixel space to identify the structural changes is difficult due to the observed discrepancy in spatial resolution.
