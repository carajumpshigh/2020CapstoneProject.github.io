## Applying Multi-Agent RL to SLAM with Graph Pose for Sampled-Data MPC and CPN of Autonomous Drone Swarms

### CUSP Capstone Project 2020

Developing methods that allow drones to autonomously navigate in different environments has been a topic of extensive research in recent years. This is mostly due to the ability of drones to navigate to places where it is dangerous for humans. Drones have been used to investigate penstocks and in search of rescue operations. Using a swarm of drones that autonomously navigates in a post-catastrophe scenario to optimally map the disaster zone has been a problem less explored. Mapping the post-catastrophe environment allows better mobilization of rescue operations which in turn can lead to saving lives. This also aids to predict effects of disasters in the future. 

In this work, we would like to propose an algorithm which conflates Reinforcement Learning and Graph Neural Networks that allows the swarm of drones to navigate the post-catastrophe environment and optimally map the entire environment using only the camera feed from the drones. The optimal path planning of the drones will happen offline, i.e on the drones and has to adapt dynamically to the changes in the environment. This work can be a milestone in using a swarm of drones to conduct human search and rescue operations in a post-disaster scenario such as earthquakes and hurricanes.
